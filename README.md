# Saturn Studio

An experimental fork of [Saturn](https://github.com/Llennpie/Saturn) that has features originally planned for the original version,
but would make too much of a difference to implement, so it made more sense to make it a separate version.

**I still encourage using the original version.** This version is intended for users that are more experienced with the program.
